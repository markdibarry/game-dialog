--HashTags--
Devs: In your Dialog class, you can override the [color=Gold]OnHash()[/color] method.
Devs: It gets triggered when your script encounters a hash tag like [color=Gold]\[#MyTag\][/color].
Devs: ^^You can assign a corresponding value as well, and add many to one block as long as they're 
    separated by white space. [color=Gold]\[#MyTag #Another=4\][/color]^^
Devs: All hash tags in a block are fed to the virtual method in a [color=Gold]Dictionary<string, string>[/color].
Devs: In the example [color=Gold]Dialog.cs[/color], we handle an "OptionColumns" tag.
Devs: Since our example option box is a GridContainer, we use it to set the Columns property.
[#OptionColumns=3]
Devs: We just used [color=Gold]\[#OptionColumns=3\][/color] to set the number of columns to three.
