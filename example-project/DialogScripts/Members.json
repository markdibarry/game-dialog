    "In this system, you can define methods and properties to be used within your scripts!",
    "What would you like to know about?",
    "How to add them",
    "By default, if you try to type a method or property name in your script that you haven\u0027t pre-defined, it\u0027ll show you an error.",
    "You\u0027ll notice, in the same folder as the example [color=Gold]Dialog.cs[/color] partial class, there\u0027s another partial file named [color=Gold]Dialog.DialogBridge.cs[/color].",
    "The extension looks for a file ending in [color=Gold].DialogBridge.cs[/color] and grabs all compatible methods and properties inside.",
    "Compatible types for properties and method parameters are string, bool, and float. The same goes for method return types, but they can also be void.",
    "If you\u0027ve added a compatible method or property to the dialog bridge, it\u0027ll be added to the file ending in [color=Gold].G.cs[/color] and will be available for use.",
    "How to use them",
    "If you have added it to the dialog bridge, just write it like this: [color=Gold]\\[MyMethod()\\][/color].",
    "We added a method called [color=Gold]Flash()[/color] as an example. Let\u0027s try it!",
    "Flash",
    "Flash![13]",
    "Go to [color=Gold]Dialog.DialogBridge.cs[/color] to take a look!",
    "How to wait for them",
    "In the example dialog bridge, we created a custom method, [color=Gold]Shake()[/color], that shakes the dialog box. Internally, it\u0027s handled asynchronously (Take a look!).",
    "Shake",
    "You can wait for it to finish before continuing with the script by writing [color=Gold]\\[await Shake()\\][/color][17], or if you don\u0027t want to wait, simply call the method name.",
    "[color=Gold]\\[Shake()\\][/color][19]. Notice that it\u0027s still writing during the effect. Cool, right?"
