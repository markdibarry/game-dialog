# Game Dialog

A free game dialog language I'm making for my personal game framework.

## Creating a file

New dialog scripts should be made using the `.dia` extension. The name of the file should be unique to the project.

## Section Title

Dialog files consist of one or more sections. To start a new section of dialog, write the title in PascalCase in between two pairs of dashes:
```gamedialog
--TestSection--
```

## Speakers and Lines

Each section is made up of one or more lines of dialog. Each line begins with the speaking character's ID, a colon, and the text you want them to say:
```gamedialog
--Greeting--
Stalone: Hello World!
```

Internally, the dialog system will call `GetName(string id)` to get the speaker's name for display. If none is defined, it will display the ID.

Add multiple speakers by separating names with a comma:
```gamedialog
--PizzaFans--
Stalone: Who likes pizza?
Twosen, Threena: Me!
```

For longer dialog lines you can wrap your text in `^^` and indent from the second line on:
```gamedialog
--MoodyExposition--
Stalone: ^^It all started on a Fall night a couple 
    years back. There was a chill in the air and 
    everyone seemed tense.^^
```

## Comments

You can add comments using two forward slashes `//`. For multiline comments, use `/*` to open and `*/` to close:

```gamedialog
--Greeting--
// This is a comment.
Stalone: Good morning! // So is this.

/*
This is a
multi-line
comment
*/
```

## goto

By default, the reader starts at the first section in the file. If you have more than one section, it's important to connect them otherwise the dialog will exit at the end of the current section. To connect them, type an open square bracket, the keyword `goto`, the neme of the section you want to "go to", and a closing square bracket:

```gamedialog
--Greeting--
Stalone: Hello World!
[goto Goodbye]

--Goodbye--
Stalone: See you later!
```

## Choices

It's common for dialog for characters to ask questions and let the player answer using multiple choices. To do so, start a line with a `?` and a space after it, then write the choice that will be displayed. Any additional dialog should be indented below the choice.

```gamedialog
--Drinks--
Stalone: I'm thirsty!
Twosen: What'll you have?
? Something strong.
    Twosen: Careful, this soda is pretty fizzy!
? Something interesting.
    Twosen: This is called a Capri-Sun!
? Milk, please!
    Twosen: Is 2% okay?
Stalone: Ah, that hits the spot!
```

## Variables

You can store and reuse simple values (floats, strings, or bools) using variables. Define or update a variable inside square brackets anywhere in your dialog.

```gamedialog
--Color--
Stalone: What's your favorite color?
? Blue
    [color = "blue"]
? Green
    [color = "green"]
? Red
    [color = "red"]
Twosen: My favorite color is [color]!;
Stalone: That's a nice pick!
```

Keep in mind, once you set a variableâ€™s type, it cannot change.

```
[color = "blue"]
[color = "plaid"] // This works
[color = 25] // This will show an error
```

## BBCode

This project supports BBCode by default, with some additional tags provided. Here's an example using the built-in `color` tag to change the text's color:

```
Stalone: My favorite food is [color=green]broccoli[/color]!
```

## Speed

Using the `PagedText` node, the text will display like a typewriter at a steady pace by default (30 chars per second). You can override this with a `speed` tag. The value is a multiplier of the default, so less than one is faster, and and greater than one is slower. Writing a closing tag resets the speed to the default.
```
Stalone: Hi, how've you been? [speed=0.4]...[/speed] Not much of a talker, huh?
```

Setting the speed to a value of 0 will make the text write as fast as it can. If you need it to change for the rest of the line, just omit the closing tag:
```
Stalone: One of my favorite things about apples is-[speed=0]OW! I JUST STEPPED ON A MOUSE TRAP!
```
